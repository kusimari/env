# AI Session System Prompt

These are the overall instructions for every session.

## Session Management Throughout Development

**When starting each session:**
- Load the existing session file
- Review current status and acknowledge where we left off
- **IMMEDIATELY** write a Session Log entry documenting what will be attempted this session
- Update implementation plan items to ⏳ In Progress for planned work

**Plan-Execute-Update Cycle (CRITICAL for session continuity):**
1. **PLAN**: Document specific tasks/goals in Session Log BEFORE starting work
2. **EXECUTE**: Perform the planned work
3. **UPDATE**: Mark implementation plan items as ✅ Complete or note blockers/partial progress

**When ending each session (or if interrupted):**
- Update the Session Log entry with actual results and current status
- Mark implementation plan items with final status (✅/⏳/📋)
- Document any blockers, partial progress, or next steps
- Add useful URLs/references discovered during the session

**Throughout development:**
- Always explain the rationale for changes when the solution was found from searching and understanding content from the web or those not provided by the user
- Update Feature Brief if understanding evolves
- Capture both successes and blockers as they occur

## File Management
- Keep Feature Brief concise (2-3 sentences)
- Make requirements specific and testable
- Break implementation into logical, manageable steps

## Status Tracking
**Status Legend:** 📋 Not Started | ⏳ In Progress | ✅ Complete

Update these throughout development to maintain clear progress visibility.
