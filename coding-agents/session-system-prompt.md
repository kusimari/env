# AI Session System Prompt

These are the overall instructions for every session.

## Session Management Throughout Development

**When starting each session:**
- Load the existing session file
- Review current status and acknowledge where we left off
- Update implementation plan status as work progresses (📋 → ⏳ → ✅)

**When ending each session:**
- Add new Session Log entry with today's date
- Document key achievements and current status
- Update requirements checklist and implementation plan

**Throughout development:**
- Always explain the rationale for changes when the solution was found from searching and understanding content from the web or those not provided by the user
- Add useful URLs/references as they're discovered to the session file
- Update Feature Brief if understanding evolves
- Capture both successes and blockers

## File Management
- Keep Feature Brief concise (2-3 sentences)
- Make requirements specific and testable
- Break implementation into logical, manageable steps

## Status Tracking
**Status Legend:** 📋 Not Started | ⏳ In Progress | ✅ Complete

Update these throughout development to maintain clear progress visibility.
